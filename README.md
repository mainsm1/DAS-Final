We are Team 1 and it Week 8
drinking age source: [https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/drinking-ages-around-the-world.html](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1144?lang=en)


We are diving into the Global Burden of Disease data from 1999-2019 to seek to better understand alcohol and substance use disorders on a global scale. Our dataset includes observations from most of the world countries for all 21 years, with measurements for the rate (per 100k people) of substance use disorder incidences (based on the DM5) and deaths.


Week 7 Questions:
+ Should we change the regime into a discrete numerical variable from 1 to 4?
+ + Would that help with testing or not make a difference?
+ Should we change the DrinkingAge into all numeric values? Total ban could be 150 yrs. and None could be 0 yrs.

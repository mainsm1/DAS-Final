We are Team 1


We are diving into the Global Burden of Disease data from 1999-2019 to seek to better understand alcohol and substance use disorders on a global scale. Our dataset includes observations from most of the world countries for all 21 years, with measurements for the rate (per 100k people) of substance use disorder incidences (based on the DM5) and deaths.
